            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Our most deare and Royall Father of euer blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> by his Royal Proclamation bearing date the sixt of August, in the twentieth yeere of His Reigne of England, for the many reasons therein mentioned, for the publique good and ease of His People, did prohibite and straitly charge and command; That no common Carrier, or other person, should goe or trauell with any Wayne, Cart, or Carriage with foure Wheeles, nor should carry with or vpon any Wayne, Cart, or Carriage, aboue the weight of twenty hundred; nor should draw any Wayne, Cart, or other Carriage, with aboue fiue Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at once, vpon such paynes and penalties as in the said Proclamation are expressed. Since which time those great disorders are much more increased, whereby, if it be not preuented, those publique Nusaunces which will destroy the generall Commerce of Our People, will become vnremediable. Wee therefore by the aduice of the Lords and others of Our Priuy Councell, doe straitly charge and command that from and after the Feast of <hi>S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Iohn Baptist</hi> now next ensuing, No common Carrier or other person vpon the Common High-wayes, doe goe or trauell with any Wayne, Cart, or Carriage, which shall haue aboue two Wheeles. Nor that vpon any Wayne, Cart or Carriage, there bee laden at once aboue twenty hundred weight, Nor that for the draught thereof there be vsed aboue fiue Horses at any one time, to the end that by these meanes the occasion of such excessiue Carriages may bee preuented, all which Wee doe straitly charge and command to be duely obserued, vpon paine of Our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy indignation, and such other penalties and punishments as by Our Lawes can bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon the Offendors. And because such extraordinarie Carriages as of late yeares
<pb facs="tcp:185707:2"/>haue beene vsed, haue heretofore by the opinion of all the Iudges beene held to bee generall and publique Nusaunces, and therefore the same ought by the Law to be seuerely punished, as that wherein the publique hath an interest. Wee doe straitly charge and command all Our Iudges and Iustices that in their seuerall places, they doe carefully and diligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of all these offences, and as much as in them lyeth, doe punish the offendors. And We doe also hereby require Our Attourney Generall for the time being, vpon notice giuen vnto him of any such Offendor, to prosecute them in a Legall course in Our Court of Star-chamber, there to receiue such Censure and Punishment, by Fine, Imprisonment, and otherwise, as their Contempts and Offences shall deserue. And We doe hereby admonish all those whom it may concerne, that they be carefull to repayre and maintaine the Highwayes, Bridges, and Causeys throughout this our Realme, according to Our Lawes and Statutes in that behalfe made, and now continuing in force, as they tender Our pleasure, and will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the contrary at their perils. And because there may bee no pretence for them to excuse themselues by reason of these excessiue Cariages, We streitly charge and enioyne them for their owne ease, to giue true information to Our Attourney Generall, of all offences and offenders against this our Proclamation. And lastly Wee doe hereby will and require all Maiors, Sheriffes, Bailiffes, Iustices of Peace, and all other Our Officers and Ministers in all our Counties and places whatsoeuer within this Our Realme, that they vse their vttermost indeauour to discouer and punish all offences and offendors against this Our pleasure and Royall commandement.</p>
